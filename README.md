# Benchmarks
This project creates svg canvases with different apporaches (regular react vs. react sets html-string with dangerouslySetInnerHTML).
It was created as a side project of [Golden Seeds](https://github.com/tmunz/GoldenSeeds) to improve the performance of it.
The second approach seems to be faster.
